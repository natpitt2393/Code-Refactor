# Code-Refactor
Project Name: Code-Refactor
A refactoring project for HTML and CSS code

Contributors: Nathaniel (Nat) Epstein

Technologies Used: HTML 5
             CSS 3

Description: I switched all div classes, which are not semantic tags used in HTML 5 protocol, to proper semantic tags. I accordingly changed names of classes in CSS so that the styles would be applied.

Added alt attributes to all images to improve search engine optimization and for accessibility for the visually impaired.

Fixed a bug with the "search engine optimization" link on the navigation bar. The working link will now direct you to the correct place.

Setup/Installation Requirements:
